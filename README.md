# Truck Routes and Bike Marked Streets in NYC 

<i>Truck routes can be dangerous places for bikers. However, truck routes are essential for the city and allow for the movement of goods. Oftentimes, GPS apps direct cyclists to use truck route streets that have unprotected bike lanes or "sharrows.</i>

Truck Routes are vital for the city to function properly. It is important to provide ample street space for trucks. Nevertheless, over 50% of fatal bike and pedestrian crashes happened on truck routes even though they make up just 13% of city roads.

Some streets have both truck routes and bike lanes which are shown by the white line. Truck routes that have protected bike lanes are not dangerous for cyclists. However, truck routes that have unprotected bike lanes or sharrows tell a different story.

Overall, trucks were involved in half of last year’s 30 bike fatalities while over 1/3rd of cyclist accidents happened on bike marked streets. Last year, a cyclist was struck by a truck on this street which has an unprotected bike lane. Bike lanes that are unprotected provide little safety from trucks, especially when the vehicles are making turns.

Many accidents occur on "sharrows” which are road markings indicating that cars and bicycles must share a lane. Two cyclists were killed last year riding in sharrows. Sharrows made up a substantial portion of the 400 miles of "bike lanes'' created during the Bloomberg administration. Some argue that sharrows do nothing to protect cyclists and are more dangerous .This is because GPS apps will advise riders to use sharrows instead of streets without any bike markings.


<b>The government should upgrade sharrows with improved bike infrastructure.</b>

<b>GPS apps should classify truck routes with unprotected bike lanes as a separate road category. GPS apps then could program cyclist trips to avoid truck routes that do not have protected bike infrastructure.</b>
